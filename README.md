Javascript Objects

Javascript is an oop language we can use to model real world items.

Classes are a tool that developers use to quickly produce similar objects.

Classes are a great way to reduce duplicate code and debugging time.

Inheritance and static method will make the code more efficient and more meaningful

Constructor

Similarities between class and objects syntax, there is one important method that sets them apart.

Javascript calls the constructor() methods everytime it creates a new instance of a class

Instances:

An instance is an objects that contains properties and methods of calls

Methods:

Getters and method to bring our class ro life.

Class method and getter syntax is the same as it is for objects except you can not include
Commas between methods.
